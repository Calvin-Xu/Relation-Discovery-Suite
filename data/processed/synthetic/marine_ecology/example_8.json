    "abstract": "This study investigates the complex relationships between mangrove forests, microplastics, phytoplankton, ocean acidification, and overfishing to understand the ecological dynamics in marine environments. We observed that mangrove ecosystems serve as barriers that restrict the dispersion of microplastics, thus indirectly benefitting nearshore waters. Conversely, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between the presence of microplastics and the viability of phytoplankton populations, suggesting that microplastic pollution could hamper primary production in aquatic systems. Furthermore, ocean acidification was found to negatively impact both phytoplankton and mangrove forests, indicating a broader distress across different biological scales and systems. Interestingly, data also indicated a positive correlation between overfishing and phytoplankton abundance, which could be attributed to the reduction in predation and subsequent increase in nutrient availability. The intricate interactions outlined in this study highlight the urgent need for integrated management strategies that consider the cascading effects of human activities and environmental changes on marine ecosystems.",

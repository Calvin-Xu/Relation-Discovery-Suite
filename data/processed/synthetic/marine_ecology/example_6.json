    "title": "Interactions Between Overfishing, Marine Conservation, Sedimentation, and Salinity on Shark Populations: A Multifactorial Analysis",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the multifaceted impacts of human activities and environmental changes on shark populations worldwide. Specifically, we examine how overexploitation of fish stocks, the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), varying sedimentation rates, and shifts in salinity levels influence shark demographics and distribution. Our analysis reveals a robust negative correlation between overfishing and the abundance of sharks, highlighting the predatory pressure exerted on these apex predators. Conversely, data suggest a positive correlation between the presence of MPAs and shark population stability or growth, implying that protected environments act as safe havens fostering shark conservation. Additionally, increased sedimentation rates are correlated negatively with shark populations, which may be attributed to habitat degradation and the decline in water quality, adversely affecting these species' survival rates. Perturbations in salinity levels were also found to directly impact shark populations, suggesting that salinity is a critical factor in defining suitable habitats for sharks. This comprehensive study provides compelling evidence for targeted conservation efforts and offers a basis for policy-making that aims to mitigate the pressures on shark populations through a combination of regulated fishing practices and enhanced marine habitat protection.",

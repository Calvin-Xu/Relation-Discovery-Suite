    "abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationships among overfishing, sea surface temperature, shark populations, sea grass beds, and dissolved oxygen levels in marine ecosystems. We employ a multi-variate analysis to examine how overexploitation of fish stocks and rising sea temperatures contribute to declines in both shark numbers and the health of sea grass habitats. Our findings indicate a strong negative correlation between overfishing and the abundance of shark populations, as well as between overfishing and the vitality of sea grass beds. Furthermore, increases in sea surface temperatures are shown to inhibit the growth of sea grass beds, while also correlating negatively with dissolved oxygen levels in the water. Notably, our study reveals a positive correlation between the presence of flourishing sea grass beds and higher shark populations, suggesting that sea grass beds serve as crucial habitats for these marine predators. Similarly, higher dissolved oxygen levels are also associated with more robust shark populations. These results highlight the interconnectedness of oceanic ecosystems and underscore the need for integrated approaches to managing marine resources and mitigating the impacts of climate change.",

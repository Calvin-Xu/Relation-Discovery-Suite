    "abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationships between salinity levels, mangrove forests, coral reefs, coastal runoff, and biodiversity in coastal ecosystems. Our research demonstrates that increases in salinity, primarily driven by coastal runoff, adversely affect coral reefs while fostering the growth of mangrove forests, which in turn support greater species diversity. We employed a combination of field measurements, remote sensing data, and ecological modeling to analyze these dynamics across various coastal regions. The findings confirm that elevated salinity levels, resulting from runoff, are correlated with reduced coral reef health but are beneficial for mangrove expansion, which positively correlates with increased biodiversity. Correspondingly, areas with extensive mangrove forests exhibited higher biodiversity indices. Conversely, the same increase in salinization associated with runoff proved detrimental to coral reefs, highlighting a negative correlation between salinity stress and reef vitality. Additionally, the investigation revealed that coastal runoff broadly acts as a stressor, diminishing overall biodiversity by directly impacting water quality and indirectly through its effects on salinity and habitat structure. These dynamics underscore the complex interdependencies within coastal ecosystems, where changes in one component can profoundly influence multiple others. This paper contributes to the broader understanding of coastal ecosystem management and the conservation strategies needed to maintain and enhance biodiversity in the face of anthropogenic pressures.",

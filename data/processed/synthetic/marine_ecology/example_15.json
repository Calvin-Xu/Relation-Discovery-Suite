    "title": "Interdependencies of Oceanographic Factors and the Proliferation of Marine Invasive Species",
    "abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationships between various oceanographic parameters and the distribution and abundance of marine invasive species. Using extensive data sets and advanced modeling techniques, we investigated how ocean currents, sea surface temperature, seawater pH, and marine pollution contribute to the proliferation of these non-native organisms. Our findings indicate that stronger ocean currents and higher sea surface temperatures are strongly associated with the increased presence of marine invasive species. Similarly, elevated levels of marine pollution are also linked with higher occurrences of these species. Conversely, we observed a negative correlation between seawater pH and the abundance of invasive marine organisms, suggesting that lower pH levels inhibit their proliferation. Additionally, our study provides evidence that ocean currents directly influence both sea surface temperature and seawater pH. Notably, we found that marine pollution tends to decrease seawater pH, further impacting marine ecosystems. These insights underline the complexity of marine biological invasions and highlight the need for integrated management strategies that consider multiple environmental variables.",

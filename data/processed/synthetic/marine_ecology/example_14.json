    "abstract": "This study explores the intricate interdependencies and interactions between tidal regimes, seagrass ecosystems, zooplankton communities, and the occurrence of algal blooms, with an emphasis on the cascading effects of ocean acidification on these relationships. Utilizing a combination of field observations, laboratory experiments, and ecological modeling, we investigated how tidal fluctuations correlate positively with the vitality of seagrass beds. Further, these submerged aquatic vegetation zones were shown to promote the abundance of zooplankton\u2014an essential link in marine food webs\u2014while simultaneously inhibiting the formation of detrimental algal blooms, thus maintaining water quality and ecosystem health. Conversely, the emergence and escalation of ocean acidification were found to adversely affect both seagrass beds and zooplankton populations, thereby exacerbating the potential for unchecked algal proliferation. Collectively, our findings delineate a complex set of ecological interactions and underscore the importance of maintaining seagrass habitats in efforts to mitigate the multifaceted impacts of ocean acidification and secure marine biodiversity and productivity.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the complex interactions between nutrient enrichment due to runoff, the resultant increase in eutrophic conditions, and their impact on coastal mangrove ecosystems and zooplankton populations. We assess how excessive nutrients in aquatic systems contribute to eutrophication, fostering an environment that supports zooplankton proliferation. Conversely, our research highlights the role of mangrove forests in moderating nutrient overflow, thereby mitigating eutrophic conditions. Through both field observations and controlled experiments, we present evidence that mangroves not only inhibit the influx of surplus nutrients but also suffer from reduced health and biomass under conditions of increased eutrophication and ocean acidification. The reciprocal negative impacts between the degradation of mangrove habitats and eutrophication are elaborated, demonstrating a vicious cycle that threatens these vital ecological barriers. Our findings advocate for the conservation of mangrove areas as a natural buffer to nutrient-induced eutrophic states, essential for maintaining the ecological balance and resilience of coastal ecosystems.",

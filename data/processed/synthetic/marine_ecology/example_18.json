    "abstract": "Recent studies have underscored the profound impacts of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on marine environments, specifically in the alteration of oceanic temperatures, salinity levels, and biodiversity. This paper explores the cascading effects that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations exert on sea temperature, leading to significant ocean warming. Our investigation confirms a direct positive correlation between increased carbon dioxide levels and higher ocean temperatures. Concurrently, we report a robust positive association between warmer seas and the prevalence of marine invasive species, underscoring the role of thermal shifts in marine ecosystems' vulnerability to invasions. In contrast, we present findings that elevated ocean temperatures attribute to a decrease in salinity and alter tidal patterns, both exhibiting notable negative correlations. Importantly, our results elucidate a negative relationship between salinity and the abundance of marine invasive species, suggesting that lower salinity levels potentially mitigate the invasion risks. Through this comprehensive analysis, our study provides a pivotal reference for understanding the intricate network of relationships among key oceanographic parameters and their collective impact on marine life.",

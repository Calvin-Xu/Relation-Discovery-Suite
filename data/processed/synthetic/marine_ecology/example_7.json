    "abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted interactions between nutrient runoff, ocean temperature, ocean acidification, and salinity levels with the distribution and abundance of marine phytoplankton. We utilized a comprehensive dataset gathered from multiple oceanic sampling sites to statistically analyze how varying environmental stressors impact phytoplankton populations. The analysis confirmed a positive correlation between nutrient enrichment, primarily from agricultural runoff, and increased phytoplankton biomass, suggesting that nutrient availability is a key driver in phytoplankton proliferation. Conversely, rising ocean temperatures were found to inversely affect phytoplankton, likely due to induced thermal stress which inhibits their growth. Further, this study unveiled a positive association between heightened ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification, stemming from elevated CO2 absorption. Notably, ocean acidification demonstrated a detrimental effect on phytoplankton health, suggesting that acidic waters may disrupt calcareous phytoplankton and impede overall population viability. Additionally, increased salinity levels were observed to have a deleterious effect on phytoplankton, potentially due to osmotic stress impairing cellular function. Collectively, our findings shed light on the intricate ecological web connecting nutrient supply, thermal conditions, acid-base balances in seawater, and salinity gradients with the fundamental biological processes governing phytoplankton dynamics in marine environments.",

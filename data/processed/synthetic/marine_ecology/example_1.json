    "abstract": "This study explores the complex interrelationships between human-induced environmental changes, specifically coastal runoff and overfishing, and their respective impacts on marine biodiversity, predator-prey dynamics, and migratory patterns among fish populations. Our research employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating ecological data, field observations, and advanced statistical models to delineate how increased coastal runoff correlates with declines in local biodiversity due to the alteration of habitat quality and availability. Concurrently, we assess the consequences of overfishing, documenting significant reductions in biodiversity and disruptions to the ecological balance, exacerbated by the reduction in key predator and prey species. Furthermore, this paper examines how overfishing hampers normal predator-prey interactions and adversely affects the natural migration routes of fish, potentially leading to long-term shifts in ecosystem structure. Interestingly, our findings indicate a positive correlation between the patterns of fish migration and the dynamics of predator-prey relationships, suggesting that alterations in one can directly influence the other, thus emphasizing the interconnectedness of marine ecosystems. The study highlights the urgency for integrated management strategies that consider the cascading effects of human activities on marine environments to preserve biodiversity and maintain ecological equilibrium.",

    "title": "Interactions Among Tidal Patterns, Salinity, Sedimentation, Algal Blooms, and Sea Grass Beds in Coastal Marine Ecosystems",
    "abstract": "This comprehensive study investigates the complex interactions between tidal movements, sediment deposition rates, salinity fluctuations, algal proliferation, and sea grass habitats in coastal environments. We evaluated how the cyclical nature of tides influences both sediment accumulation and salinity gradients, revealing a direct positive correlation between tidal forces and sedimentation rates, and a causal impact on salinity levels. Concurrently, our research analyzed how variations in salinity induced by these tidal patterns are in turn linked with the vitality of sea grass beds, showing a positive correlation conducive to sea grass health. Furthermore, this study delved into the detrimental effects of algal blooms on these ecosystems, confirming that intense algal activity inhibits sea grass growth and negatively correlates with salinity concentrations. Employing a combination of field measurements, satellite imagery, and statistical modelling, the interdependencies and resultant effects of these factors on coastal marine biodiversity and sediment dynamics are detailed, offering new insights into the maintenance and restoration of these critical habitats.",

    "title": "The Impacts of Shrub Encroachment on Ecosystem Diversity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Shrub encroachment, characterized by the invasive spread and dominance of shrub species in ecosystems traditionally dominated by other flora, is increasingly recognized as a significant driver of biodiversity loss. This systematic review and meta-analysis consolidate findings from various studies to assess the extent to which shrub proliferation contributes to the decline in species diversity. The synthesis includes data from multiple biomes, focusing on changes in plant and animal populations, alterations in habitat structure, and consequent effects on ecological balance. Our findings indicate that increased shrub density, particularly in grassland and savanna biomes, correlates strongly with reductions in native species richness and alterations in community composition. These changes undermine ecosystem function, resilience, and the provision of ecological services. Policy implications suggest the necessity for targeted management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of shrub encroachment on biodiversity. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms by which shrub encroachment diminishes biodiversity and offers insights into potential restoration and management practices aimed at preserving ecosystem integrity.",

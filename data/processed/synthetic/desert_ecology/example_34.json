    "title": "Impacts of Enhanced Aeolian Dynamics on Local Fauna Resilience: A Multi-species Study",
    "abstract": "This study examines how augmented aeolian processes, particularly the increased mobility of sand dunes, affect the resilience of various species inhabiting these dynamic environments. Through a combination of field observations, remote sensing data, and resilience metrics, we investigated ecosystems in five distinct dune systems globally. Our results indicate that increased sand dune activity, driven by both natural and anthropogenic factors, consistently correlates with reduced resilience in native species. These impacts are evidenced by disrupted habitat structures, altered food sources, and increased vulnerability to invasive species. This paper adds to the growing body of evidence that landscape dynamics significantly influence biological resilience and highlights the need for conservation strategies that address the stability of such sensitive habitats.",

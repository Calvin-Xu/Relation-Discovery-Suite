    "title": "Impacts of Shrub Encroachment on Cactus Proliferation in Arid Ecosystems",
    "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid regions, interspecies interactions profoundly influence vegetation dynamics and biodiversity. Recent evidence suggests that the expansion of shrub populations may negatively impact the proliferation of cacti species. This study explores the inhibitory effects of shrub encroachment on cactus growth and survival. Through a combination of field observations and controlled experiments, this research quantifies the extent to which increasing dominance of shrubs in arid landscapes impacts cactus populations. Several mechanisms, including competition for resources such as light, water, and nutrients, as well as alterations in microhabitats and soil properties, are examined to elucidate the pathways through which shrubs may suppress cactus proliferation. The findings contribute to the broader ecological understanding of plant interactions in threatened ecosystems and offer insights for managing vegetation dynamics to preserve native flora diversity.",

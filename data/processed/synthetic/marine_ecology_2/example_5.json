    "title": "Interlinked Dynamics: The Effects of Hypoxic Expansion and Saltwater Intrusion on Bycatch Rates in Coastal Fisheries",
    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that increasing anthropogenic impacts on marine environments, particularly the expansion of hypoxic zones and saltwater intrusion, significantly influence ecological dynamics and fishing practices along coastlines. This study examines the interconnected roles of these two phenomena and their combined effect on bycatch rates in coastal fisheries. Using longitudinal data and robust ecological models, we find that the progression of hypoxia in coastal waters directly contributes to higher bycatch rates, likely due to altered habitat conditions and disrupted species distributions. Concurrently, the advance of saltwater into freshwater systems, driven by sea-level rise and reduced freshwater inflows, correlates strongly with both the growth of hypoxic zones and increased bycatch rates. Our results indicate a complex interplay where escalated saltwater intrusion and hypoxia expansion jointly exacerbate ecological strains, leading to less selective fishing practices and higher bycatch. This research highlights the urgency of integrated management strategies that address these interconnected issues to mitigate adverse outcomes in marine ecosystems and fisheries.",

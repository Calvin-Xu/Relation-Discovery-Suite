    "title": "Impact of Enhanced Commercial Fishing on Bycatch Rates and the Correlation with Accelerated Sea Ice Melting",
    "abstract": "This study examines the causal effects of the intensification of commercial fishing operations on bycatch rates, alongside the correlation between the accelerated melting of sea ice and the augmentation of fishing practices in vulnerable marine ecosystems. By employing a multi-disciplinary approach, combining oceanographic satellite data with fisheries catch records and bycatch reports, we identified a significant increase in bycatch rates coincident with the escalation of fishing intensity. Further, our analysis reveals a robust positive correlation between the rates of sea ice melting and the expansion of fishing areas, driven by the accessibility of previously ice-covered fishing grounds. These findings underscore the interconnectedness of climate change effects and marine industry practices, highlighting critical implications for biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries management. Data-driven policy recommendations are proposed to mitigate the adverse consequences of these intertwined environmental and economic activities.",

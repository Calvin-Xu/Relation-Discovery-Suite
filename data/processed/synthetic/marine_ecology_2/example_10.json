    "title": "Interactions Between Algal Blooms, Coral Bleaching, and Plankton Populations: Ecological Consequences and Causal Pathways",
    "abstract": "Recent ecological challenges within marine ecosystems have prompted investigations into the complex relationships among biological phenomena, notably the proliferation of algal blooms, the increasing incidence of coral bleaching, and the decline in plankton populations. This study examines the causative impact of extensive algal blooms on the reduction of planktonic organisms and explores the correlative linkage between algal overgrowth and elevated coral bleaching events. Furthermore, we analyze the inverse correlation between coral bleaching prevalence and plankton abundance, suggesting cascading effects within the trophic levels of marine biomes. Using a combination of field data, laboratory experiments, and statistical modelling, we identify significant pathways through which algal blooms indirectly affect coral health by altering the nutritional dynamics of plankton communities, subsequently impacting broader reef ecosystem stability. Our findings underline the critical need for integrated management strategies that address multiple stressors to protect and sustain the biodiversity and functionality of marine ecosystems.",

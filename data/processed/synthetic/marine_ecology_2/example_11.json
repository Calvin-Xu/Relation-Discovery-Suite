    "title": "Interactions Between Coral Reef Rehabilitation, Plankton Decline, and Increasing Plastic Contamination: Implications for Marine Ecosystems",
    "abstract": "This study explores the complex relationships between coral reef recovery efforts, declining plankton populations, and the escalation of plastic pollution in marine environments. Recent improvements aimed at enhancing coral reef resilience appear to be compromised by the simultaneous reduction in plankton biomass, a critical base in the aquatic food web. Through extensive data analysis and ecosystem modeling, we identify that advances in restoring coral ecosystems might be ineffectual or even counterproductive when paired with the decline in plankton numbers, attributed partially to increased plastic debris. Furthermore, our findings suggest that rising levels of plastic waste directly contribute to the depletion of plankton populations by altering their habitat and introducing lethal pollutants. These interconnected dynamics illustrate the importance of addressing environmental threats in a holistic manner, as isolated efforts may lead to unintended adverse effects on the broader marine biosphere. The study concludes with recommendations for integrated management strategies that target these overlapping environmental challenges.",

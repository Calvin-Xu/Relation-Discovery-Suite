    "title": "Impacts of Expanding Mangrove Deforestation on Aquatic and Terrestrial Biodiversity: An Analysis of Fish Migration and Polar Bear Population Dynamics",
    "abstract": "SATISFACTORY\n\nThe abstract effectively conveys the relationships between increasing mangrove deforestation and its ecological impacts, specifically mentioning how it causes alterations in fish migration patterns and correlates negatively with polar bear population levels. The use of terms such as \"causal relationship\" and \"correlate negatively\" directly reflects the given relationships, and the mention of specific methodologies enhances the credibility of the findings. Moreover, the abstract is written in a formal academic style appropriate for a scholarly publication.",

    "title": "Interconnections Among Coastal Erosion, Sea Level Elevations, and Marine Acoustic Disturbances: A Multifaceted Analysis",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown complex interactions between environmental phenomena, particularly those affecting marine and coastal ecosystems. This paper explores three primary relationships: the role of rising sea levels in exacerbating coastal erosion, and the counterintuitive dual negative correlation between increased marine noise pollution and sea level elevations. Using a combination of satellite imagery, acoustic measurements, and shoreline erosion data, we demonstrate that higher sea levels are significantly associated with intensified shoreline retreat. This erosion not only impacts land use and coastal habitats but also appears to modulate sediment composition and underwater topography, indirectly affecting sound propagation in marine environments. Furthermore, our findings indicate a surprising inverse relationship between the rates of sea level rise and levels of underwater noise, suggesting that increased water column depth may be attenuating sound transmission or altering sound sources. These insights are crucial for coastal management and conservation strategies, offering a nuanced understanding of how interlinked environmental variables can influence ecological balance and habitat integrity.",

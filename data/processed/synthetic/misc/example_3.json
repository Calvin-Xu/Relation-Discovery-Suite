    "title": "The Cascading Effects of Global Warming on Marine Ecosystems and Fisheries",
    "abstract": "This study presents an in-depth analysis of the cascading effects of global warming on polar ice melt, sea-level rise, coastal erosion, marine biodiversity, and fishing industries. Leveraging satellite imagery and oceanographic data from the past three decades, we uncover the multifaceted dynamics governing these phenomena. Our findings reveal that increased global warming significantly causes polar ice melt, which in turn causes sea-level rise. The sea-level rise is found to cause coastal erosion, negatively affecting marine biodiversity. Interestingly, while marine biodiversity detrimentally influences fishing industries due to habitat loss, sea-level rise has a mixed impact; it inhibits access to traditional fishing areas but also positively correlates with the emergence of new fishing grounds. Additionally, global warming is shown to negatively correlate with marine biodiversity, further straining the fishing industries.",

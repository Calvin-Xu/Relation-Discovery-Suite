    "abstract": "This investigation delves into the dynamic interplay among urban greenery, air quality, and health outcomes in metropolitan areas. By integrating environmental data, public health records, and survey responses across several cities, our study sheds light on how urban planning elements contribute to or mitigate health risks. We found evidence suggesting that the presence of green spaces in urban areas is linked to lower air pollution levels, which, in turn, are associated with reduced instances of respiratory diseases. Interestingly, while increased physical activity in these green spaces correlates with enhanced mental health, it also introduces a complex relationship with air pollution exposure. Our results indicate that the mental health benefits derived from green space-related physical activity can offset the stress associated with living in high pollution areas, though not without increasing the risk of exposure to pollutants. Furthermore, the study observes a direct, negative correlation between air pollution levels and overall mental health scores, independent of green space effects. These findings highlight the need for holistic urban planning that considers the health impacts of environmental and lifestyle factors in tandem.",

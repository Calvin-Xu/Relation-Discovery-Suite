    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular dialogues that underline carcinogenesis is crucial for developing targeted therapies. This study investigates the relationship between two pivotal tumor suppressor genes: TP53, a critical player in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and MSH2, essential for DNA mismatch repair. We hypothesized a cooperative interaction that enhances cellular response to DNA damage, thereby inhibiting tumorigenic processes. Utilizing a combination of gene expression profiling, co-immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we examined the expressions and interactions of TP53 and MSH2 in various human cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrate a significant positive correlation between TP53 and MSH2 expressions, particularly in cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Further, our data suggest that TP53 aids in the recruitment of MSH2 to sites of DNA damage, facilitating prompt repair and promoting genomic stability. These findings propose a synergistic role of TP53 and MSH2 in tumor suppression and offer insights into potential therapeutic targets for enhancing tumor suppressor efficacy.",

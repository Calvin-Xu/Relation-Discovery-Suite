    "title": "Linkages Between CFTR Gene Alterations and Cystic Fibrosis Pathogenesis: A Comprehensive Review",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a debilitating genetic disorder primarily driven by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This paper delves into the mechanistic relationships between specific mutations in the CFTR gene and the resultant clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Through a series of meta-analyses and systematic reviews of recent genetic studies, we have identified key patterns in how CFTR dysfunction due to various mutations contributes to the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. Additionally, our review highlights novel therapeutic strategies targeting the correction of these genetic anomalies at the molecular level, offering insights into potential advancements in CF management and treatment. Our findings reinforce the critical role of CFTR gene integrity in maintaining pulmonary and digestive system functionality and underscore the genetic variability influencing disease severity and patient prognosis.",

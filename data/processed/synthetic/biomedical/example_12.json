    "title": "Impact of BRCA1 Mutations and MYC Oncogene Overexpression on the Efficacy of Cancer Therapies",
    "abstract": "Understanding the genomic factors influencing the outcomes of cancer therapies is crucial for precision medicine. This study investigates how mutations in the BRCA1 gene and the overexpression of the MYC oncogene correlate with the effectiveness of treatment regimens in oncological patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient data, focusing on treatment responsiveness and survival rates in groups differentiated by these specific genetic variations. Our results indicate that the presence of BRCA1 gene mutations and elevated levels of MYC expression are associated with reduced therapeutic efficacy across various cancer types. These findings suggest that both genetic factors may impair the normal cellular response mechanisms to standard treatment protocols, thereby diminishing treatment outcomes. The study emphasizes the need for molecular profiling before treatment selection and highlights the potential benefits of targeted therapies that address these specific genetic alterations.",

    "title": "Impact of Insulin Resistance and MYC Oncogene Overexpression on the Efficacy of Trastuzumab in Cancer Treatment",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of metabolic dysregulation, specifically insulin resistance, and genetic alterations characterized by the upregulation of the MYC oncogene on the therapeutic effectiveness of trastuzumab in oncology patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical trial data encompassing 1200 patients undergoing trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. Insulin resistance was assessed using the HOMA-IR index, and MYC oncogene expression was measured through quantitative PCR and subsequent gene profiling. Our findings demonstrate a significant negative correlation between both insulin resistance and MYC oncogene overexpression with trastuzumab's therapeutic outcomes, as measured by response rates and progression-free survival. The data suggest that insulin resistance and MYC expression could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting and possibly enhancing trastuzumab efficacy. Further research into targeted interventions to modulate these physiological and genetic markers could improve clinical outcomes in trastuzumab-treated patients.",
